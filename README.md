Connect to virtual machines

There are several ways to access your Azure virtual machines. The Azure portal supports options for connecting your Windows and Linux machines, and making connections by using Azure Bastion. The following diagram shows how you can connect Azure virtual machines with the SSH and RDP protocols, Cloud Shell, and Azure Bastion.


Why we used it :- For creating docker image


Step 1: Create an Azure Container Registry



1.	Navigate to the Azure Portal: Log in to the Azure Portal.



Create a new Azure Container Registry:

Click on "Create a resource."

Search for "Container Registry" in the Marketplace.

Fill in the required information, including a unique registry name, resource group, and other settings.

Review and create the registry.



Step 2: Authenticate Docker with Azure Container Registry

Install Azure CLI:

If you haven't installed the Azure CLI, you can download it here.



Login to Azure:

Open a terminal and run:



bash codeaz login

Get ACR Credentials:

Run the following command to get the login server, username, and password for your Azure Container Registry:



bash



az acr credential show --name <your-registry-name>

Note down the username and password.



Login to ACR with Docker:

Run the following Docker command to log in to the Azure Container Registry:



bash



docker login <your-registry-name>.azurecr.io -u <username> -p <password>

Step 3: Build and Push Docker Image

Build Docker Image:

Navigate to your project directory containing the Dockerfile and run: bash


dockerbuild-t<your-registry-name>.azurecr.io/<image-name>:<tag> .

Push Docker Image:

Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry:

docker push<your-registry-name>.azurecr.io/<image-name>:<tag>

Step 4: Pull Docker Image for Deployment

Login to ACR (if not already logged in):

docker login <your-registry-name>.azurecr.io -u <username> -p <password>

Pull Docker Image:

docker pull <your-registry-name>.azurecr.io/<image-name>:<tag>

Step 5: Use the Docker Image in Deployment

Integrate the pulled Docker image into your deployment process, whether it's deploying to Azure Container Instances, Kubernetes, or any other container orchestrator.



These steps provide a basic overview of using Azure Container Registry with Docker. Depending on your specific use case and deployment scenario, you might need to adapt these steps. Always refer to the official Azure Container Registry documentation for the most up-to-date information and detailed instructions.
